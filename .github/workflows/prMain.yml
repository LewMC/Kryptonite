            **Thank you for opening a pull request to Essence.**
            
            You've requested to merge something into `main`, please note that if you're adding, removing, or changing a feature on Kryptonite you must merge into `next-update` so that compatability can be checked properly with any other pending changes.
            
            We unfortunately do not accept any pull requests into `main`, [for more information please click here](https://github.com/LewMC/Kryptonite/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please close and reopen your pull request into `next-update` if this is the case.
            
            Thank you!
